# Green Garlic Soup

from: [Orangette](http://orangette.blogspot.com/2008/04/that-easy.html)

## Ingredients

* 2 Tbsp. olive oil
* 1 Tbsp. unsalted butter
* 1/2 to 3/4 lb. green garlic, thinly sliced (white and pale green parts only)
* Salt
* 1 qt. vegetable or mild chicken broth
* 8 to 10 oz. baby spinach leaves
* 1 Tbsp. crème fraîche

## Instructions

Warm the olive oil and butter in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the green garlic and a pinch of salt, and cook, stirring frequently, until it is soft and translucent. Also, as the garlic cooks, you should notice that its scent changes from raw and sharp to sweeter and more mellow; that’s what you’re after. When the garlic is ready, add the stock, raise the heat a bit, and bring it to a boil. Then adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer, and continue to cook for about 15 minutes. Add the spinach, and immediately turn off the stove. Let it sit for 5 minutes – not too long, or the spinach will lose its color – and then, working in batches, purée the mixture in a blender. (Remember never to fill the blender more than a quarter or a third full, because the hot liquid will expand when you turn on the motor.) The soup should be a rich shade of green and very smooth.

Return the soup to the pot, and place it over low heat to rewarm gently. Add 1 Tbsp. crème fraîche and another pinch or two of salt. Taste, and adjust seasoning as necessary.

Serve warm or hot, with a drizzle of olive oil or a dollop of crème fraîche, if you like.
